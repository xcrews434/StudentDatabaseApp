# StudentDatabaseApp

This is a simple student management system written in java that incorporates object oriented programming.

This program does the following:

- Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database.

- The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student.

- The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level.

- A student can enroll in classes.

- Each course should costs $600 to enroll.

- The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition.

- To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance.
